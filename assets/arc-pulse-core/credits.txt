This ARC Pulse Core appears heavily used and needs a bit of work, but with the right amount of love and a few spare parts it will be functional again. The standard ARC Pulse Core can be installed into a class C (or lower) transport shipâ€™s propulsion systems. The Pulse Core is somewhat similar to the power steering of an automobile. It allows for faster split-second deceleration, which provides greatly increased maneuverability. The Core reroutes excess plasma before it hits thrusters and holds it briefly, releasing the discharge inversely as rapid minute pulses.

The invention of this simple bit of tech led to the rising popularity of racing ships and fast-turning war machines. The industrial grade shown here was designed for medium-size frigates and is able to stabilize the momentum of massive payloads.
